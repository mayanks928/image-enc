# Image Encryption using Chaos Maps

This is a Github repository containing code for image encryption using three different chaos map algorithms: Arnold Cat Map, Henon Map, and Logistic Map. These algorithms offer a good combination of speed, high security complexity, and low computational overheads when compared to traditional encryption methods like AES and RSA.

Arnold Cat Map: This is a well-known chaotic map often used for pixel manipulation. It applies a transformation to the image that shuffles the pixels by stretching and folding the image. When an optimal number of iterations of the transformation is applied, the resulting image becomes incomprehensible and hence encrypted.

Henon Map: This is a two-dimensional map that is commonly used for image encryption. It involves a non-linear transformation of the pixel positions in the image that can be iterated many times to produce a highly scrambled image.

Logistic Map: This is another one-dimensional chaotic map that can be used for image encryption. It involves a non-linear transformation of the pixel values in the image that can be iterated many times to produce a highly scrambled image.
